## Extraction Methodology

### Search Techniques for Remaining Prompts

#### 1. String Pattern Searches
```javascript
// Search patterns to use:
- Long template literals: \`[^`]{300,}
- Multiline strings: "[^"]{300,}
- String concatenation: \+ "[^"]+" \+
- Template variables: \${[^}]+}
- Description fields: description:.*"[^"]+"
- Usage fields: usage:.*"[^"]+"
```

#### 2. Function Name Patterns
```javascript
// Functions that might construct prompts:
- buildPrompt, getPrompt, constructPrompt
- buildContext, getContext, assembleContext
- buildMessage, getMessage, formatMessage
- getToolDescription, getToolPrompt
- getSystemPrompt, getSystemInstructions
```

#### 3. Object/Constant Searches
```javascript
// Objects that might store prompts:
- PROMPTS, TEMPLATES, MESSAGES
- TOOL_DESCRIPTIONS, TOOL_PROMPTS
- SYSTEM_PROMPT, SYSTEM_INSTRUCTIONS
- ERROR_MESSAGES, PERMISSION_MESSAGES
```

#### 4. Base64 Encoded Strings
- Search for base64 patterns that might contain encoded prompts
- Decode and check for prompt content

- MCP protocol support for extensibility

### Technical Challenges
1. **Minified Code Analysis**: The cli.js is webpack-bundled and minified, making direct analysis challenging
2. **Hidden Prompts**: System prompts and templates are embedded in the minified bundle
3. **Runtime Behavior**: Some behaviors only observable during execution
4. **Closed Source**: Core logic is proprietary and obfuscated

### Remaining Mysteries
- Exact prompt templates and system instructions
- Context window optimization algorithms
- Specialized subagent types and capabilities
- Planning and reasoning implementation
- Code understanding beyond pattern matching
- Learning and adaptation mechanisms

## Proposed Investigation Methods

1. **Dynamic Analysis**: Run Claude Code with debug flags and observe behavior
2. **Network Inspection**: Monitor API calls to understand prompt construction
3. **Behavioral Testing**: Create test scenarios to infer internal logic
4. **Documentation Mining**: Extract insights from official docs and GitHub issues
5. **SDK Experimentation**: Use programmatic SDK to test edge cases

## Documentation Status

1. **Architecture Overview** - Package structure, core components, process model
2. **Message Flow & IPC** - SDK-CLI communication, JSON protocol, control messages
3. **Tool System** - 21+ tools categorized, permission system, execution patterns
4. **Prompt Engineering** - Context building pipeline, template structure (inferred)
5. **Actual Prompts Extracted** - 8 complete tool prompts, system instructions, error messages

### Planned Documentation
6. **Agentic Flow** - User query processing, context engineering, subagent architecture
7. **State Management** - Conversation history, session persistence, working memory
8. **Security Architecture** - Permission modes, sandboxing, process isolation
9. **Development Guide** - SDK usage, programmatic access, extension points
10. **Implementation Details** - Webpack bundling, minification analysis, hidden features

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Continue extracting remaining tool prompts (MultiEdit, NotebookEdit, WebFetch, WebSearch, Agent, MCP tools)
2. Search for encoded or obfuscated system prompts
3. Document the complete agentic flow based on findings
4. Create state management documentation

### Future Investigation
