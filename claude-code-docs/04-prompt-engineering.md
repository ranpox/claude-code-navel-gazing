# Prompt Engineering & Context Management

## Overview

Claude Code's prompt engineering system is deeply embedded within the minified CLI bundle. While the complete system prompts are obfuscated, we have extracted some actual prompt fragments and can infer the architecture from the SDK patterns and tool descriptions.

**Note**: See [05-actual-prompts-extracted.md](./05-actual-prompts-extracted.md) for actual prompts found in the source code.

## Inferred Prompt Architecture

### 1. Context Building Pipeline

Based on the SDK and tool analysis, Claude Code likely builds context through multiple layers:

```
User Query
    ↓
Context Assembly
    ├── CLAUDE.md (if exists)
    ├── Working Directory Info
    ├── Tool Descriptions
    ├── Session History
    └── Dynamic Context
    ↓
Prompt Construction
    ↓
Claude API Request
```

### 2. Context Components

#### System Context
- **Identity**: Claude Code identification and capabilities
- **Environment**: Working directory, platform, date/time
- **Permissions**: Available tools and access levels
- **Instructions**: Behavioral guidelines and constraints

#### User Context
- **CLAUDE.md**: Project-specific instructions and context
- **Working Directory**: Current path and repository status
- **Session State**: Previous messages and tool results
- **Active Tools**: Currently enabled tool set

#### Dynamic Context
- **Tool Results**: Accumulated from file reads, searches
- **Code Understanding**: Built from Grep, Glob, Read operations
- **Error States**: Previous failures and recovery context
- **Task Progress**: TodoWrite state and completion status

### 3. Tool Description Injection

Each tool has embedded descriptions that are likely injected into prompts:

```typescript
// Example from sdk-tools.d.ts
interface ToolDescription {
  name: string;
  description: string;  // Detailed tool capabilities
  parameters: {        // Schema for validation
    [key: string]: any;
  };
}
```

### 4. Prompt Template Structure (Inferred)

Based on common LLM patterns, the prompt likely follows:

```
[System Instructions]
- Claude Code identity and purpose
- Behavioral constraints
- Tool usage guidelines
- Safety and security rules

[Environment Context]
- Platform: {os_type}
- Working Directory: {cwd}
- Available Tools: {tool_list}
- Date: {current_date}

[User Context]
- CLAUDE.md contents (if exists)
- Recent conversation history
- Active task state

[User Query]
{user_message}

[Tool Results]
{accumulated_context}
```

### 5. Context Window Management Strategies

#### Prioritization
1. **Recent First**: Latest messages and tool results
2. **Relevance Scoring**: Based on file paths and content
3. **Task Context**: Active todos and goals
4. **Tool Results**: Compressed and summarized

#### Compression Techniques
- **Summarization**: Long outputs condensed
- **Deduplication**: Remove redundant information
- **Selective Loading**: Only relevant file sections
- **History Truncation**: Older messages dropped

### 6. Specialized Prompts

#### Planning Mode
- Enhanced reasoning instructions
- Step-by-step decomposition emphasis
- No immediate execution directive

#### Subagent Prompts
- Focused task description
- Limited tool access
- Specific output requirements
- Context isolation

### 7. Model-Specific Adaptations

The system likely adjusts prompts based on:
- **Model Capabilities**: Different instructions for different models
- **Token Limits**: Prompt size optimization
- **Response Patterns**: Model-specific formatting

## Security Considerations in Prompts

### Built-in Constraints
- Path traversal prevention
- Command injection protection
- Sensitive data handling
- Permission enforcement

### Dynamic Safety
- Runtime permission checks
- User approval workflows
- Sandbox mode instructions
- Error boundary handling

## Performance Optimizations

### Prompt Caching
- Common instructions cached
- Tool descriptions pre-loaded
- Environment context reused
- Template compilation

### Lazy Loading
- Tools loaded on demand
- Context built incrementally
- History loaded as needed
- Dynamic expansion

## Integration Points

### CLAUDE.md Integration
- Loaded at session start
- Injected into system context
- Overrides default behavior
- Project-specific instructions

### Tool Result Integration
- Streaming incorporation
- Progressive context building
- Selective inclusion
- Format normalization

## Challenges and Limitations

### Obfuscation
- Prompts embedded in minified code
- Webpack bundling obscures structure
- Runtime construction makes static analysis difficult

### Dynamic Nature
- Prompts built at runtime
- Context-dependent variations
- Model-specific adjustments
- Version-specific changes

## Future Investigation

### Potential Methods
1. **Runtime Inspection**: Hook into API calls
2. **Network Analysis**: Capture actual prompts
3. **Behavioral Testing**: Infer from responses
4. **Debug Mode**: If available, enable verbose output

### Key Questions
- How are system prompts versioned?
- What triggers prompt template changes?
- How is context priority determined?
- What are the exact truncation strategies?

## Conclusions

While the exact prompts remain hidden in the minified bundle, the architecture reveals a sophisticated context management system that:

1. Dynamically builds context from multiple sources
2. Prioritizes relevant information
3. Manages token limits intelligently
4. Adapts to different models and modes
5. Enforces security through prompt constraints

The prompt engineering in Claude Code represents a careful balance between capability, safety, and performance.
