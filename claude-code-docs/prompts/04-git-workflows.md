# Git Workflows and Instructions

## Committing Changes with Git

When the user asks you to create a new git commit, follow these steps carefully:

### Step 1: Gather Information
You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. ALWAYS run the following bash commands in parallel, each using the Bash tool:
- Run a git status command to see all untracked files.
- Run a git diff command to see both staged and unstaged changes that will be committed.
- Run a git log command to see recent commit messages, so that you can follow this repository's commit message style.

### Step 2: Analyze and Draft
Analyze all staged changes (both previously staged and newly added) and draft a commit message:
- Summarize the nature of the changes (eg. new feature, enhancement to an existing feature, bug fix, refactoring, test, docs, etc.). Ensure the message accurately reflects the changes and their purpose (i.e. "add" means a wholly new feature, "update" means an enhancement to an existing feature, "fix" means a bug fix, etc.).
- Check for any sensitive information that shouldn't be committed
- Draft a concise (1-2 sentences) commit message that focuses on the "why" rather than the "what"
- Ensure it accurately reflects the changes and their purpose

### Step 3: Execute Commit
You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. ALWAYS run the following commands in parallel:
- Add relevant untracked files to the staging area.
- Create the commit with a message ending with:
```

```
- Run git status to make sure the commit succeeded.

### Step 4: Handle Failures
If the commit fails due to pre-commit hook changes, retry the commit ONCE to include these automated changes. If it fails again, it usually means a pre-commit hook is preventing the commit. If the commit succeeds but you notice that files were modified by the pre-commit hook, you MUST amend your commit to include them.

### Important Notes for Commits
- NEVER update the git config
- NEVER run additional commands to read or explore code, besides git bash commands
- NEVER use the TodoWrite or Task tools
- DO NOT push to the remote repository unless the user explicitly asks you to do so
- IMPORTANT: Never use git commands with the -i flag (like git rebase -i or git add -i) since they require interactive input which is not supported.
- If there are no changes to commit (i.e., no untracked files and no modifications), do not create an empty commit
- In order to ensure good formatting, ALWAYS pass the commit message via a HEREDOC:

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
   Commit message here.

## Creating Pull Requests

Use the gh command via the Bash tool for ALL GitHub-related tasks including working with issues, pull requests, checks, and releases. If given a Github URL use the gh command to get the information needed.

IMPORTANT: When the user asks you to create a pull request, follow these steps carefully:

### Step 1: Understand Current State
You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. ALWAYS run the following bash commands in parallel using the Bash tool, in order to understand the current state of the branch since it diverged from the main branch:
- Run a git status command to see all untracked files
- Run a git diff command to see both staged and unstaged changes that will be committed
- Check if the current branch tracks a remote branch and is up to date with the remote, so you know if you need to push to the remote
- Run a git log command and `git diff [base-branch]...HEAD` to understand the full commit history for the current branch (from the time it diverged from the base branch)

### Step 2: Analyze Changes
Analyze all changes that will be included in the pull request, making sure to look at all relevant commits (NOT just the latest commit, but ALL commits that will be included in the pull request!!!), and draft a pull request summary

### Step 3: Create Pull Request
You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. ALWAYS run the following commands in parallel:
- Create new branch if needed
- Push to remote with -u flag if needed
- Create PR using gh pr create with the format below. Use a HEREDOC to pass the body to ensure correct formatting:

```bash
gh pr create --title "the pr title" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
<1-3 bullet points>

## Test plan

```

### Important Notes for Pull Requests
- NEVER update the git config
- DO NOT use the TodoWrite or Task tools
- Return the PR URL when you're done, so the user can see it
